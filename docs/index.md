I will post the instructions code necessary for the computational exercises that we will do in the class.

## Alignments

The first module is on multiple sequence alignments and it is divided in two parts:

[Part 1: Aligments with MAFFT online and Mesquite](https://cjpardodelahoz.github.io/BIO556L/alignments_online)

[Part 2: Aligments in the command line on the DCC](https://cjpardodelahoz.github.io/BIO556L/alignments_dcc)
