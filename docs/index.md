I will post the instructions code necessary for the computational exercises that we will do in the class.

## Alignments

The first module is on multiple sequence alignments and it is divided in two parts:

[Alignments Part 1: MAFFT Online and Mesquite](https://cjpardodelahoz.github.io/BIO556L/alignments_online)

[Alignments Part 2: MAFFT in the Command Line on the DCC](https://cjpardodelahoz.github.io/BIO556L/alignments_dcc)

## Models of Evolution and Tree Inference

We are then going to look at different ways of selecting models of sequence evolution and how to use them in likelihood and bayesin tree inference. This is divided in two parts:

[Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference](https://cjpardodelahoz.github.io/BIO556L/bayes)
