# Systematic Biology Lab Repository
I will post the instructions code necessary for the computational exercises that we will do in the class.

## Alignments

The first module is on multiple sequence alignments and it is divided in two parts:

[Alignments Part 1: MAFFT Online and Mesquite](https://cjpardodelahoz.github.io/BIO556L/alignments_online)

[Alignments Part 2: MAFFT in the Command Line on the DCC](https://cjpardodelahoz.github.io/BIO556L/alignments_dcc)

[Choosing Models of Sequence Evolution](https://cjpardodelahoz.github.io/BIO556L/models)
